# Proverb API Core

[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/johnnyreilly/proverb-api-core)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JohnReilly/proverb-api-core)

Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  This is a collection of variations upon a the proverb theme.  Different versions of "Proverb" built using different technologies and techniques for kicks and giggles.  It's a playground for me.  

This repository is using the following technologies:

- ASP.Net Core
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server Azure

The focus of this repository is being the API which multiple front ends can plug into.
